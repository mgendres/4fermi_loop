This code simulates a two-dimensional four-component Fermi gas using a loop-updating algorithm described in:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6182
https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3104
https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6694

Simulation parameters are hard-coded, and may be set in:

params.h

To compile run:

./make.sh


====DEBUGGING AND MEMORY USE====

A useful tool for detecting memory leaks/use and profiling is valgrind:

http://valgrind.org/

The following tools are included:

1) To profile memory use, run:

valgrind --tool=massif ./a.out

2) To detect memory leaks, access of unallocated memory locations, etc.,, run:

valgrind --leak-check=yes ./a.out

3) Profiling can be done with

valgrind --tool=callgrind ./a.out
callgrind_annotate [options] callgrind.out.<pid>
